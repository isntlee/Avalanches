#The Avalanches

-The project was to build a website for an Australian electronic music group, the core challenge was to mirror the group's
eccentric style in the user interface and aesthetic choices made.
-In tension with these ambitions, was the clear neccesity to make the website as functional and rational as possible.


##UX

-This site is supposed to be a band site is the guise of current band sites, such Franz Ferdinand and Mumford & Sons.

-The site owner's goal is to maintain a media platform for the group that reflects the group's personality. The audience
that this site has been specifically designed for are people unfamilar with the group, but, of course, fans should enjoy it to.

-The ambition of the site is to showcase the music and music videos of the group, while subtly informing them of upcoming tour-dates
and the most recent album. These features are in place to create a feeling of excitement about the group, while maintaining a literal
"price-less" aesthetic, purchases can be made one-click away but no prices are visible on the site. This was a choice made due to the
clear counter-cultural aethetic maintained by the group, outright commercial features would alienate the intended audience.

User Stories
a) First time listener/user:  searches for site, trying to learn more about musical group. First item seen is the video loop of first
major hit single Due to disorientating nature of video loop the user is curious and slightly on-edge, these intial impressions are
reinforced with the video player set to play "Frankie Sinatra" the lead single from the new album.

b) Current fan: opens site trying to find email updates, scrolls past identifiably separate elements to contact/detail section which
is traditionally at the bottom of a site. The section is completely functional and very subtly reinforces the group's aesthetic.
